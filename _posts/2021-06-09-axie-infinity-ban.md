Axie Infinity is a crypto game that allows you to buy NFT characters (Axies) and plays them like a card game.

It got really popular in my [hometown](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/people-in-philippines-earn-cryptocurrency-playing-nft-video-game-axie-infinity.html). People are playing it for fun and maybe "investment". Investment because you gain tokens while playing the game which can be exchange into ethereum. In my hometown, the returns from the game can be larger than the minimum wage. Although, the barrier of entry is pretty high. That's why in this game, there are so called managers and scholars. Managers will buy the Axies and the scholars will play it. They will just divide their "earnings" afterwards.

My brother introduced me to this game. I got curious and tried it for "funinvestment". I started by buying the three required Axies. I played it for day, and gave it to my "scholar" afterwards. Admittedly, the game is pretty fun. I actually considered buying more Axies soon.

Unfortunately, after my scholar played it for day, we got banned.

Yes, we got banned. Why? We don't know. I would appreciate a response from the Axie Infinity though. Well, they said that there are only few reasons why they are banning players.
