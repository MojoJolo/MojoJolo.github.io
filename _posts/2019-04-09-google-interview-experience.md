Last January, I received an email from a Google recruiter asking if I'm interested for a quick call. I scheduled the call a day after. She talked about Google, ask about my experience, behavioral questions, and a few technical questions just to gauge my computer science knowledge. I didn't manage to answer correctly on some of her technical questions. She told me that I need to review for the actual technical interview. Luckily, she let me schedule my technical interview. To have a lot of time to review, I scheduled it one month after. She also provided me tips and review links that I can use to prepare for my interview.

Throughout the month, I reviewed various computer science topics starting from basic sorting algorithm to dynamic programming. I started from this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUMzthTXOs&list=PLJse9iV6Reqg-IffRqjxebaPg0zaPxWlt) about sorting alrogithms which I [posted](https://jolo.xyz/blog/2019/01/14/basic-sorting-review) few weeks ago. I also read few chapters of **Cracking the Coding Interview** and tried answering the questions in the book. I make sure that I just write my answers rather than typing it in front of a computer.

I also studied data structures especially trees, graphs, and hashmaps. Knowing the difference and writing the code for **breadth first search** and **depth first search** is really valuable. Solving problems with **dynamic programming** helps a lot. But understanding DP is quite a struggle.

The interview is a 45 minute call that started with a system design question. After that, the interviewer will provide the technical question that needs to be coded using Google Docs. That is why practicing coding in a paper is essential because in the actual interview, no compiler is allowed.

I was asked with a horse in a chess board problem. I will not discuss more about the problem but in essence, it can be solved by simply breadth first search. Unfortunately, I made critical mistakes in my implementation. First, I tried optimizing it prematurely which resulted into a wrong implementation. Second, I mistakenly interchange the for loop and while loop in my BFS implementation. Funny when the code is traced, the implementation resulted into a depth first search. The interview ended and I'm not sure how it went.

After a few days, the recruiter scheduled a call to provide feedback. She mentioned that my interview got a mixed feedback. She provided valid comments which I agreed having the same sentiments regarding the interview. She mentioned that I will have another technical interview call to get a more concrete feedback. I scheduled the call two weeks after because I have an on site interview in Singapore (Agoda) coming up.

The second technical interview for me is really disappointing. I think the question is really hard, but I also jump into conclusion that it is a dynamic programming solution. Eventually, the interviewer made me realized that it can be solved by basic recursion that I also didn't managed to answer. In the end, I expected my interview to be a failure.

After a few weeks, the recruiter scheduled another feedback call. She mentioned that they will not push through with my application which I expected. Although, she mentioned that I can reapply again in the future. Let's see, maybe next time.
