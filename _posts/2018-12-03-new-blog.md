My old blog, a customized Tumblr page was stuck with a content I wrote two years ago. Interestingly, it is about [generating Pokemon names using LSTM](https://jpbalbin.tumblr.com/post/147087216235/generating-pokemon-names-using-neural-network). RNN and LSTM have come a long way since I wrote that post. I also toyed with LSTM again last year for a [post](https://blog.indigoresearch.xyz/become-a-mocha-uson-commenter-using-lstm/) at our Indigo Research blog.

I'm creating a new blog to serve as my platform for sharing my learnings / knowledge / thoughts mainly in artificial intelligence but also other random interesting contents. I'm also hoping to expand my network through this blog.

This blog was built using Github Pages with Jekyll. It is actually easy to setup. I recommend following [this tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) by Jonathan Mcglone to those interested in setting it up.

That's it for now. Stay tuned!
