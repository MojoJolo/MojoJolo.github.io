I'm currently reviewing the basic sorting algorithms. I'm writing this blog to serve as my notes that I can look back when needed in the future.

Much thanks to this [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/lcc0612/) for explaining the basic sorting algorithms very well. I really recommend his [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUMzthTXOs&list=PLJse9iV6Reqg-IffRqjxebaPg0zaPxWlt) explaining those algorithms.

### Basic Sorting Algorithms


#### Selection Sort


###### Worst Case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
###### Average Case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
###### Best Case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)

- sorting like a deck of cards
- running through the list to find the smallest number
- smallest number will be put in the end

#### Bubble Sort
###### Worst Case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
###### Average Case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
###### Best Case: O(n)

- moves (bubbles) the biggest / smallest to the end
